** Gen YAML
** Gen HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Config>>
** Compare
   Consider the following data structure:
HashMap<service_name:String, HashMap<process_name:String, Config>>

For each service in tm_struct:
Browse the hashmap 1 looking for service_name == Service::service_name
If no match => REMOVE SERVICE
If match => { for each thread in service: {
		browse the hashmap 2 looking for process_name == SErvice::thread_name (in the hashmap)
		if no match => Remove thread
		if match => {
			Compare content of config :
			if difference on fatal point, kill and re-launch, in the map,
			othwerwise edit value in both process local value and thread public config
			numproc ??? Consider it a fatal change ? Or spawn-dwpawn current - new ?
		}
